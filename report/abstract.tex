    In this study, we explore the performance of the three trade execution algorithms: Time--Weighted Average Price (TWAP), Almgren--Chriss (AC), and Greedy exploitation in Limit Order Book Execution (GLOBE). We specifically investigate the variability in the performance of the algorithms, which is influenced by the selected parameters.

    Using real market data and empirical analysis, we compare the execution costs, market impact, and overall trade outcomes of these algorithms. Our findings provide insights into the AC algorithm's performance, highlighting the importance of parameter selection in optimizing trade execution.

    Understanding the nuances of algorithmic trading approaches helps market participants improve their execution strategies and achieve more efficient trading in electronic markets. This research contributes to the development and refinement of trade execution frameworks by highlighting the impact of parameter choice on algorithm performance. 
    
    This study provides valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of utilizing these algorithms for optimal trade execution, contributing to the advancement of research in this field.
