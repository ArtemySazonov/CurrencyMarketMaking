    In this study, we compare two trade execution algorithms, Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Greedy exploitation in Limit Order Book Execution (GLOBE), with a focus on their performance for short-term price impact assumption and small traders. TWAP serves as a baseline strategy, while GLOBE is an adaptive approach that leverages market dynamics for optimized execution.

    Using historical market data and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of both algorithms in minimizing execution costs and achieving optimal trade outcomes. Our findings reveal that GLOBE outperforms TWAP in scenarios where short-term price impact has a significant influence and for small traders.
        
    This research provides valuable insights for small traders and market participants utilizing short-term price impact assumptions, highlighting the advantages of adopting adaptive execution strategies like GLOBE. Understanding the trade-offs and benefits of different algorithms enables traders to make informed decisions that align with their specific requirements and market dynamics.
