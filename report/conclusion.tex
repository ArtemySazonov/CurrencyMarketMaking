    During the semester we studied three trade execution algorithms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Time-Weighted Average Price;
        \item Almgren-Chriss model with linear impact functions;
        \item Greedy exploration in Limit Order Book Execution.
    \end{enumerate}
    We found out that TWAP is the most versatile of them all, but is not being the optimal one (given the parameters for the AC and GLOBE algorithms are estimated correctly). 
    The AC model has the closed-form solution for the strategy only in case of the 
    linear price impact functions, and it's optimal strategy is deterministic.
    The GLOBE algorithms rely on the correctness of the chosen parameters, which cannot be easily estimated or guessed.
    In this case it gives less costs on average to execute the trade uniformly in time.
    The number of things we could improve during the next semester:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Implement the calibration of AC and GLOBE parameters;
        \item Implement some other RL algorithms (Q-learning etc.) to compare them with;
        \item Invent (or at least try to) our own algorithms;
        \item Implement the MOEX simulator for a proper backtest (either TCP or multithreading);
        \item Deploy some of the most successful algorithms to the real market.
    \end{enumerate}

    We intend to continue our research in this field, and we hope that our work will be useful for the further studies.
