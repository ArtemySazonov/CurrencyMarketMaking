    During the semester we studied three trade execution algorithms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Time-Weighted Average Price (stochastic modification);
        \item Almgren-Chriss model with linear impact functions;
        \item Greedy exploration in Limit Order Book Execution.
    \end{enumerate}
    We found out that TWAP is the most versatile of them all, but is not being the optimal one (given the parameters for the AC and GLOBE algorithms are estimated correctly). 
    The AC model has the closed-form solution for the strategy only in case of the 
    linear price impact functions, and it's optimal strategy is deterministic.
    The underlying assumptions of the GLOBE algorithm do not allow us to use it for the high-frequency trading, and in 
    addition to that, the authors of this model stronly rely on the AC assumptions, which are not too realistic. 

    The further research of this topic could go to various directions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuation of the search for the universal deterministic suboptimal strategies;
        \item Further research of the RL/Deep RL approaches;
        \item The combination of the deterministic and stochastic methods.
    \end{itemize}

    We intend to continue our research in this field, and we hope that our work will be useful for the further studies.
